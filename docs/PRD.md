Understood. Below is a **clean, consolidated PRD v1.1 rewrite**, incorporating all earlier inserts **and explicitly aligned to Vercel + NeonDB**. This is **engineering-ready** and suitable as the single source of truth for product, design, and development.

I am **not summarising**—this is a **structural rewrite**, tightened where needed, with infra assumptions baked in.

---

## 7. Functional Requirements

---

### 7.1 User Management

**No change**, plus:

* Seller verification tiers:

  * Tier 0: Phone OTP
  * Tier 1: ID upload (manual review)
  * Tier 2: Ghana Card (Phase 2)

---

### 7.2 Land Listing Management

**Additions (Phase 1 mandatory):**

* Audit trail (who changed what, when)
* Duplicate detection:

  * GPS polygon proximity
  * Document hash matching
* Family land requires authority evidence before “Platform Reviewed”

---

### 7.3 Search & Discovery

---

### 7.4 Verification System (Clarified)

#### Verification Levels

| Level | Description                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Unverified                                  |
| 1     | Documents uploaded                          |
| 2     | Platform reviewed                           |
| 3     | Official verification (LC / Partner Lawyer) |

**Important:**
Level 2 and below are **informational only**, not legal guarantees.

---

### 7.5 Transaction Management

#### Transaction is a State Machine (non-negotiable)

```
CREATED
→ ESCROW_REQUESTED
→ FUNDED
→ VERIFICATION_PERIOD
→ READY_TO_RELEASE / DISPUTED
→ RELEASED / REFUNDED / PARTIAL_SETTLED
→ CLOSED
```

Invalid transitions must be blocked at API level.

---

### 7.6 Payment & Transaction Protection (Reframed)

**Phase 1 = Transaction Protection (Milestone Holding)**

* Payments handled via Theteller (Payswitch) / Hubtel
* Funds held pending milestones
* Admin approval required for:

  * Transactions > GH₵500,000
  * Any dispute resolution
* Full legal escrow terminology avoided unless PSP-compliant

---

| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Frontend        | Next.js App Router                        |
| Hosting         | Vercel                                    |
| API             | Vercel Serverless / Edge                  |
| DB              | NeonDB (Postgres + PostGIS)               |
| ORM             | Prisma                                    |
| Storage         | S3-compatible (Cloudflare R2 recommended) |
| Background Jobs | Vercel cron / external worker             |
| Maps            | Mapbox                                    |

**Important Constraints:**

* No stateful backend assumptions
* All workflows must tolerate cold starts

---

### 8.2 Database

* Neon branching for environments
* PostGIS enabled
* Strict migrations
* Read replicas in Phase 2

---

### 8.3 Security

No downgrade from v1.0. JWT + RBAC + encryption remain mandatory.

---

## 9. Feature Specifications

(9.0 Map Hero retained; explicitly client-side only, lazy-loaded to avoid Vercel edge limits.)

---

## 10. User Flows

Flows unchanged, but now **enforced via backend state machines**.

---

## 11. Wireframes & Mockups

No functional change.

---

## 12. Success Metrics & KPIs

No change.

---

## 13. Regulatory & Compliance

Clarification:

* Platform **does not guarantee ownership**
* Verification is informational unless explicitly stated
* Funds handling governed by PSP agreements

---

## 14. Dependencies & Integrations

**Updated Infrastructure Dependencies**

| Dependency | Provider               |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Hosting    | Vercel                 |
| Database   | NeonDB                 |
| Storage    | Cloudflare R2 / AWS S3 |
| Payments   | Theteller (Payswitch), Hubtel       |
| SMS        | Hubtel / mNotify       |
| Email      | AWS SES                |
| Maps       | Mapbox                 |

---

## 15. Risks & Mitigations

**New Risk Added:**
Serverless timeouts for verification → mitigate with async jobs + polling.

---

## 16. Release Plan

### Phase 1 MUST INCLUDE:

* Audit logs
* Dispute initiation
* Transaction state enforcement
* Seller tiering
* Document vault

Anything less risks platform credibility.

---

## 17. Out of Scope

Unchanged.

---

## 18. Open Questions (Reduced)

Remaining open questions:

* Installment payments (Phase 2)
* Full legal escrow wording (pending PSP agreements)

---

## 19. Appendix

Glossary unchanged.

---

### Summary View (High Level)

**Phase 1 Core Modules:**
Auth, Listings, Geo/Maps, Search, Documents, Offers, Transactions, Payments, Messaging, Verification (Platform), Trust & Safety, Disputes, Admin, Audit

---

Understood. If those Phase 2–3 modules must be **active** (i.e., included in the build scope now), the project becomes a **full-ecosystem platform** rather than an MVP marketplace. Below is the **updated module set**, plus the **minimum architecture adjustments** required to deliver them on **Vercel + NeonDB** without rework.

---

## Updated Active Modules (Phase 1 now includes the former Phase 2–3 items)

### 20. Professional Services Marketplace Module

**Purpose:** Let buyers/sellers book and pay for surveyors, lawyers, architects, engineers, etc.

**Sub-modules**

* Professional onboarding + credential capture
* License verification status (manual first; automated later)
* Service catalog (services, pricing, turnaround time)
* Service requests / job posts (linked to listing/transaction)
* Booking workflow (request → accept/decline → schedule)
* Service delivery artifacts (reports, drawings, letters)
* Reviews/ratings (optional but recommended active)
* Professional payouts (milestone/approval-based)

**Key data entities**

* ProfessionalProfile, ProfessionalService, ServiceRequest, Booking, Review, ServicePayment, DeliverableDocument

---

### 21. Building Permit Processing Module

**Sub-modules**

* Permit application wizard (project details, plot details, drawings upload)
* Auto checklist per assembly (configurable)
* Fee payment (PSP)
* Submission + status tracking
* Query/objection handling (upload responses)
* Approval outcome + permit certificate storage
* SLA timers + reminders

**Key data entities**

* PermitApplication, PermitDocument, PermitFeePayment, PermitStatusHistory, AssemblyConfig, PermitQuery

**Operational reality (important)**

* “Integration” may be **manual bridge** initially (admin submits/coordinates) unless assemblies provide APIs.

---

### 22. Ghana Card API Integration Module (KYC)

**Purpose:** Strong identity verification for sellers, high-value buyers, and professionals.

**Sub-modules**

* KYC step-up rules (threshold-based)
* Ghana Card capture (ID number + selfie/liveness if supported)
* Verification requests + callbacks/webhooks
* KYC decisioning (pass/fail/retry/manual review)
* Audit logs + evidence vault retention policy

**Key data entities**

* KycRequest, KycResult, KycProviderLog, IdentityDocument, RiskFlag

---

### 23. Mobile Apps Module (iOS / Android)

**Purpose:** First-class mobile experience, offline viewing, push notifications.

**Sub-modules**

* React Native app(s) (recommended single codebase)
* Auth (OTP + token refresh)
* Listing discovery + map view
* Favorites + saved searches
* Messaging
* Transaction tracking
* Offline cached listings
* Push notifications (FCM)

**Architecture requirement**

* Backend APIs must be stable and versioned from day one (see Public API module).

---

### 24. USSD Channel Module

**Purpose:** Non-smartphone users can search, verify status, and track transactions.

**Sub-modules**

* USSD session engine (stateful sessions stored in DB/redis)
* Menus: search by region/district/price, view listing summary
* OTP login / verification
* Transaction status lookup
* Support ticket creation via USSD
* SMS fallback for long responses

**Critical hosting note**

* USSD needs a **public webhook endpoint** with low latency and high reliability. Vercel can host the endpoint, but you should use:

  * a dedicated route handler + strict timeouts,
  * plus a lightweight queue for any heavy operation.

---

### 25. Public API / Developer Platform Module

**Purpose:** Controlled external access and partner integrations.

**Sub-modules**

* API keys + scopes + rate limiting
* Tenant/partner management
* API versioning (`/v1`, `/v2`)
* OpenAPI documentation
* Webhooks (transaction updates, listing status changes)
* Audit logs for API calls
* Sandbox mode

**Key data entities**

* ApiClient, ApiKey, ApiScope, ApiUsageLog, WebhookEndpoint, WebhookEvent, RateLimitBucket

---

## What must change in the platform design (so this works cleanly)

### 1) You now need “Workflow Engines”

Because permits, KYC, USSD, and marketplace bookings are **process-heavy**, you need standardized workflow primitives:

* Status history tables
* SLA timers
* Event logs + webhooks
* Background jobs (cron + queue)

### 2) You must add an “Integration Layer”

These modules depend on external providers:

* KYC provider
* USSD aggregator
* District Assembly workflows (manual or API)
* Push notifications

Design as:

* `/integrations/*` service layer in code
* provider-agnostic interfaces
* provider-specific adapters

### 3) You should introduce Multi-Tenancy now (if Developer Platform is active)

If you truly mean “developer platform” (partners/third parties), add:

* `tenant_id` to most core tables
* row-level access constraints
* tenant-level config (fees, assembly templates, USSD menus)

If you don’t want multi-tenant yet, limit the “developer platform” to:

* read-only APIs + strict scopes
* no partner write access until Phase 2

---

## Immediate updates I recommend to your PRD v1.1

To reflect “these are active,” add these sections:

1. **Functional Requirements**

* Add full sections for:

  * Professional Marketplace
  * Building Permit Processing
  * KYC (Ghana Card)
  * Mobile Apps
  * USSD
  * Developer Platform (API keys, rate limiting, webhooks)

2. **Dependencies & Integrations**

* Add:

  * USSD aggregator (Hubtel USSD / Africa’s Talking / etc.)
  * Ghana Card verification provider (or NIA integration if available via partner)
  * Assembly workflow (manual bridge + later API)

3. **Roadmap**

* Replace Phase 1/2/3 with **streams running in parallel**, because mobile + USSD + API must ship alongside core APIs.

---


Below is a **complete RBAC permissions matrix** for Buy Ghana Lands, covering **all active modules** (core + Professional Marketplace + Permits + KYC + Mobile + USSD + Public API). It is written so you can directly translate it into: `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, and `policy checks` in code.

---

## 1) Roles (System + User + Institutional)

### Platform Roles (primary)

* **GUEST** (not logged in)
* **BUYER**
* **SELLER**
* **AGENT** (seller-like privileges + portfolio scale)
* **PROFESSIONAL** (service provider)
* **SUPPORT** (customer service ops)
* **COMPLIANCE** (KYC, AML, risk)
* **FINANCE** (payments/payouts/reconciliation)
* **MODERATOR** (listing moderation, content safety)
* **ADMIN** (full platform control)
* **SUPER_ADMIN** (infrastructure/security; minimal users)

### Institutional Roles (optional but recommended if permits are “active”)

* **ASSEMBLY_REVIEWER** (District Assembly staff)
* **LANDS_COMMISSION_REVIEWER** (verification partner)

> Implementation note: One user can hold multiple roles. RBAC checks should be **union-of-permissions** with “deny overrides” for suspensions.

---

## 2) Permission Design Pattern (how to implement cleanly)

Use permissions as:
`<module>:<resource>:<action>`

Examples:

* `listing:manage:create`
* `transaction:status:update`
* `kyc:request:create`
* `api:key:rotate`

Also define **scopes**:

* **OWN** (only resources the user owns)
* **ASSIGNED** (resources assigned to them)
* **ANY** (all resources)

---

## 3) RBAC Matrix by Module (Actions + Role Access)

Legend:

* ✅ Allowed (with stated scope)
* ⛔ Not allowed
* ⚠️ Allowed with conditions (noted)
* 🛡️ Admin-only / restricted

---

## 4) Cross-Cutting “Holds” and “Denies” (must implement)

These are not roles; they are **account flags** that override permissions:

### Global Deny Flags

* `isSuspended = true` → blocks all write actions (except support contact)
* `kycHold = true` → blocks: publish listing, accept offer, fund transaction, payout
* `payoutHold = true` → blocks: payouts/withdrawals
* `fraudUnderInvestigation = true` → blocks: listing publish, transaction progress beyond verification

This prevents “role escalation” from bypassing compliance.

---

## 5) Minimal Permission List (for your permissions table)

If you want to implement via `Permission` records, start with these core permissions:

* `user:manage:any`
* `listing:create:own`
* `listing:edit:own`
* `listing:publish:any`
* `listing:suspend:any`
* `document:view:redacted`
* `document:view:full:party`
* `transaction:view:party`
* `transaction:status:update:any`
* `payment:reconcile:any`
* `payout:execute:any`
* `dispute:resolve:any`
* `kyc:override:any`
* `permit:status:update:any`
* `api:key:manage:own`
* `api:scope:assign:any`
* `webhook:manage:own`
* `fraud:case:manage:any`

---


Below is the **end-to-end workflow** you should implement for Buy Ghana Lands, covering **RBAC authorization flow** (how access is decided) and the **key business workflows** across the newly-active modules.

---

## 1) RBAC Authorization Workflow (Request → Decision → Audit)

### Step 1: Identify actor and session

1. Request hits API (web/mobile/USSD/public API).
2. Resolve identity via one of:

   * **User JWT** (web/mobile)
   * **USSD MSISDN session** (mapped to User if verified)
   * **API Key** (developer platform)

### Step 2: Load authorization context

Fetch:

* `user.roles[]`
* `user.flags` (suspended, kycHold, payoutHold, fraudUnderInvestigation)
* Resource ownership/relationship (OWN / PARTY / ASSIGNED / ANY)
* Optional: tenant context (if enabled)

### Step 3: Evaluate hard “deny overrides” first (non-negotiable)

If any is true, block relevant actions even if role permits:

* `isSuspended` → block all writes (except support contact)
* `kycHold` → block: publish, accept offer, fund transaction, payout, permit submit (if you want)
* `payoutHold` → block payouts
* `fraudUnderInvestigation` → block publish + transaction progression

### Step 4: RBAC permission check

Evaluate:

* Does role OR explicit permission allow `module:resource:action`?
* Is the scope valid? (OWN / PARTY / ASSIGNED / ANY)
* Are required prerequisites satisfied? (e.g., phone verified, tier met)

### Step 5: Policy-based constraints (business rules)

Examples:

* Seller cannot publish if Tier 1 KYC not complete
* Buyer cannot fund transaction until offer accepted
* Professional cannot accept booking if licenseStatus is REJECTED

### Step 6: Decision + audit log

* Allow → continue
* Deny → return structured error (`403` + reason code)
* Always write an **audit log** for sensitive operations (payments, status changes, KYC decisions, admin actions).

---

## 2) Core Marketplace Workflow (Search → Offer → Transaction Protection → Completion)

### A) Buyer discovery

1. Buyer searches listings (map + filters).
2. Buyer views listing details (redacted docs only).
3. Buyer messages seller/agent.

### B) Offer & negotiation

1. Buyer makes offer.
2. Seller/agent accepts or counters.
3. Once accepted, the system:

   * Locks price
   * Creates `Transaction` in `CREATED` state
   * Creates payment request for transaction funding

### C) Transaction protection (escrow-style milestones)

1. Buyer funds transaction → `FUNDED`
2. Verification period starts → `VERIFICATION_PERIOD`
3. Buyer confirms satisfaction:

   * If no dispute → `READY_TO_RELEASE`
   * If dispute → `DISPUTED`
4. Admin/Finance releases funds → `RELEASED` (payout executed)
5. Transaction closes → `CLOSED`

Key enforcement: **Only valid state transitions are allowed**.

---

## 3) KYC (Ghana Card) Workflow (Step-up Identity)

### A) Trigger rules

KYC required when:

* Seller wants to publish (Tier 1 minimum)
* Buyer exceeds threshold (e.g., > GH₵100k)
* High-risk flag raised
* Professional registers to offer services

### B) Process

1. User initiates KYC → `KycRequest(INITIATED)`
2. Provider call → `PENDING`
3. Provider callback/webhook updates:

   * `PASSED` → unlock gated actions
   * `FAILED/RETRY` → enforce holds + allow retry
   * `MANUAL_REVIEW` → Compliance queue
4. Compliance decision recorded (override allowed only to Compliance/Admin)
5. Audit log created (mandatory)

---

## 4) Professional Services Marketplace Workflow (Request → Booking → Deliverables → Payment)

### A) Request

1. Buyer/seller posts `ServiceRequest(OPEN)` linked to listing/transaction.
2. Professional receives and responds:

   * Accept → `ACCEPTED`
   * Decline → `DECLINED`

### B) Booking

1. `Booking(REQUESTED)` created on acceptance
2. Schedule confirmed → `CONFIRMED`
3. Work begins → `IN_PROGRESS`

### C) Deliverables + completion

1. Professional uploads deliverables (reports/drawings) as documents linked to booking
2. Mark delivered → `DELIVERED`
3. Client approves → `COMPLETED` (or disputes)

### D) Payment handling

* If you require “upfront” payment: capture before `IN_PROGRESS`
* If milestone-based: release after `COMPLETED`
* Finance executes payouts; disputes freeze payouts.

---

## 5) Building Permit Workflow (Application → Review → Queries → Approval)

### A) Application creation

1. User creates `PermitApplication(DRAFT)`
2. Upload required documents via `PermitDocument`
3. Pay permit fees (if required) → `PermitFeePayment`

### B) Submission & processing

1. Submit → `SUBMITTED`
2. Admin or Assembly reviewer sets:

   * `UNDER_REVIEW`
   * `QUERY_RAISED` (with `PermitQuery`)
3. Applicant responds → `RESUBMITTED`
4. Decision:

   * `APPROVED` (attach permit certificate document)
   * `REJECTED` (record reasons)
5. Status history records every change.

Note: If Assemblies lack APIs, treat as **manual bridge** with internal operators.

---

## 6) USSD Workflow (Session → Menus → Actions)

### A) Session management

1. Aggregator calls `/api/ussd` with `sessionId + msisdn + text`
2. Create/update `UssdSession(state, currentStep)`
3. Respond with menu text within 3–5 seconds.

### B) Supported USSD actions

* Search by region/district/price
* View listing summaries (limit results)
* Track transaction status (only if phone linked to account)
* Create support ticket request

### C) Security

* Sensitive actions require OTP verification (link MSISDN ↔ user).

---

## 7) Public API / Developer Platform Workflow

### A) Partner onboarding

1. Admin/Compliance approves partner
2. Partner creates `ApiClient`
3. Admin assigns allowed scopes
4. Partner generates API key (store hash only)

### B) Request processing

1. API request includes key
2. Validate key hash + status
3. Check scope for endpoint
4. Rate-limit
5. Log request (`ApiUsageLog`)
6. Return response

### C) Webhooks

1. Event occurs (e.g., transaction status change)
2. Create `WebhookDelivery(PENDING)`
3. Worker/cron attempts delivery
4. Retry with backoff; mark `DEAD` after threshold

---

Below are the **connected user workflows** from **Guest → Buyer/Seller/Agent/Professional → Transaction → Verification → Permits → Construction Docs**, showing how each flow hands off to the next. I’m writing this as a **single system journey map** with clear “connection points” (the objects that link workflows: Listing, Offer, Transaction, ServiceRequest, Booking, PermitApplication, Documents).

---

# 0) Guest Entry Workflow (Guest → Account)

## 0.1 Guest explores

**Guest can do:**

* Browse landing page + map
* Search/filter listings
* View listing details (limited fields)
* View professional directory (public)
* Read guides/FAQs

**Triggers to convert from Guest:**

* “Save listing”
* “Message seller”
* “Make offer”
* “List your land”
* “Request verification”
* “Apply for permit”
* “Request site plan / survey”
* “Request architect drawings”
* “Track transaction”

**Connection point created:** none yet
**Next workflow:** **Account creation + role selection**

---

# 1) Guest → Buyer or Seller (Onboarding + Role Assignment)

## 1.1 Create account (common)

1. Guest clicks **Sign Up**
2. Enters phone/email → OTP verification
3. Creates profile

**Connection point:** `User`

### 1.2 Choose path (role)

User chooses one or more:

* **Buyer**
* **Seller**
* **Agent**
* **Professional** (Surveyor/Lawyer/Architect/etc.)

> Users can hold multiple roles. The UI should present it as “What do you want to do today?”

---

## 1A) Buyer Workflow (Search → Inquiry → Offer → Transaction)

1. Buyer searches listings (map/list)
2. Opens listing → reviews photos + redacted docs
3. Clicks **Message seller/agent**
4. Clicks **Make Offer**
5. Negotiation (counter/accept)
6. Offer accepted → system creates **Transaction**

**Connection points created:**

* `Conversation` (optional)
* `Offer`
* `Transaction`

**Next workflows that connect here:**

* Verification workflow (ownership/doc checks)
* Professional services workflow (survey, legal, etc.)
* Payments workflow (funding)
* Permits workflow (if buyer wants to build)

---

## 1B) Seller Workflow (Create Listing → Publish → Offers → Transaction)

1. Seller clicks **List your land**
2. Completes listing wizard (location, polygon, media, docs)
3. Submits for review
4. Moderator approves → listing published
5. Receives inquiries/offers
6. Accept offer → **Transaction** created
7. Seller uploads additional transaction docs as requested

**Connection points created:**

* `Listing`
* `Documents`
* `Offer`
* `Transaction`

**Next workflows that connect here:**

* Verification workflow (to increase trust)
* Professional services workflow (site plan/title/legal)
* Payments + payout workflow

---

# 2) “Get an Agent to Work on Permits / Site Plan / Land Title Documentation”

This is a **Professional Marketplace** flow. An “Agent” here can be:

* A platform **AGENT role** (real estate agent)
* Or a **Professional** (surveyor/lawyer) depending on service.

## 2.1 Entry points (how user initiates)

From anywhere:

* Listing page → “Need help verifying this land?”
* Transaction page → “Hire a lawyer/surveyor”
* Dashboard → “Request a site plan / title documentation / permit support”
* Permit hub → “Get an agent to handle permit end-to-end”

## 2.2 Service request (Agent-led)

1. User chooses a service:

   * **Site Plan / Survey**
   * **Title Search / Documentation**
   * **Permit Processing**
   * **Due diligence + family land documentation**

2. System creates `ServiceRequest(OPEN)` linked to:

   * `listingId` (if before purchase), or
   * `transactionId` (if after offer accepted)

3. Matching:

   * User chooses a specific agent/professional, OR
   * Platform suggests based on region + rating + availability

4. Agent accepts → system creates `Booking`

**Connection points created:**

* `ServiceRequest`
* `Booking`
* `Documents` (deliverables)

## 2.3 Deliverables

Depending on service type:

* Surveyor uploads **site plan** / boundary report
* Lawyer uploads **title search report** / conveyancing docs
* Agent uploads **permit submission receipt** / status updates

**Where it connects next:**

* If land purchase is ongoing → attach deliverables to `Transaction`
* If permit process is needed → create or update `PermitApplication`
* If a dispute arises → `Dispute` module

---

# 3) “Get an Architect/Draftsman to Produce Construction Documents for Permits”

This is another Professional Marketplace path, typically initiated after:

* Buyer has land (or is confident to proceed), and
* Permit workflow begins.

## 3.1 Entry points

* Permit hub → “Need drawings for permit?”
* Transaction completion → “Start building: apply for permit”
* Listing saved → “Request preliminary design + estimate”

## 3.2 Request architectural services

1. User selects:

   * **Concept design** (optional)
   * **Permit drawings (Architectural)**
   * **Structural drawings** (if needed)
   * **MEP drawings** (optional depending on assembly)

2. System creates `ServiceRequest` linked to:

   * `permitApplicationId` (recommended), or
   * `listingId`/`transactionId` if permit not yet created

3. Architect/draftsman accepts → `Booking(CONFIRMED)`

4. Architect uploads deliverables:

   * Architectural drawings PDF set
   * Schedules / notes
   * Any required forms

**Connection points created:**

* `ServiceRequest`
* `Booking`
* `Document` (deliverables)
* Optionally links to `PermitApplication`

## 3.3 Handoff to permits

Once drawings are uploaded:

* Permit module checks “required docs list”
* User can now click **Submit permit**

**Next connected workflow:** Building permit submission + review cycle

---

# 4) Building Permit Workflow (Connected End-to-End)

## 4.1 Create permit application

1. User clicks **Apply for Permit**
2. Selects District Assembly
3. Auto-checklist appears (based on assembly config)
4. Upload docs (site plan, drawings, ownership docs)
5. Pay fees (if applicable)
6. Submit → status becomes `SUBMITTED`

**Connection points created:**

* `PermitApplication`
* `PermitDocument`
* `PermitFeePayment`
* `PermitStatusHistory`

## 4.2 Review cycle (Assembly/Admin bridge)

* Under review → `UNDER_REVIEW`
* If query raised → `QUERY_RAISED` + `PermitQuery`
* User responds (uploads corrections) → `RESUBMITTED`
* Final outcome:

  * `APPROVED` (permit certificate uploaded)
  * `REJECTED` (reasons logged)

**Next connected workflow:**

* Construction phase onboarding (optional module)
* Contractor/quantity surveyor sourcing (future extension)

---

# 5) Diaspora Workflow (Remote purchase + representation)

This is essentially the Buyer workflow with extra steps:

1. Diaspora buyer selects listings
2. Requests **on-ground verification** via professional booking
3. Funds transaction after verification evidence
4. Uses milestone approvals (documents received, site visit confirmed, etc.)
5. Proceeds to permit workflow remotely (architect + agent handle)

**Connections:**

* `ServiceRequest` becomes critical for representation
* `Transaction` milestones rely on professional deliverables

---

# 6) “Etc.” — Additional Connected Workflows You Should Support

## 6.1 Land verification workflow (before purchase)

* From listing → “Request verification”
* Creates `VerificationRequest`
* Results update listing badge
* Can be attached to transaction as evidence

## 6.2 Title documentation workflow (after purchase)

* From transaction completion → “Start title documentation”
* Creates `ServiceRequest` for lawyer
* Deliverables stored in document vault
* Can be used for future resale listing (pre-filled verification)

## 6.3 Dispute workflow (any stage)

* From transaction, service booking, or permit
* Creates `Dispute`
* Freezes payouts until resolved

---

# 7) How all workflows connect (Object Graph)

This is the “spine” of your platform:

* **Guest → User**
* **User(Buyer) → Offer → Transaction**
* **User(Seller) → Listing → Offer → Transaction**
* **Transaction ↔ Documents ↔ Verification**
* **Transaction/Listing/Permit → ServiceRequest → Booking → Deliverables**
* **Deliverables → unlock PermitApplication submission**
* **PermitApplication → Approval → Permit Certificate**
* **Any of the above → Dispute → Resolution**

---

## Recommended UI Navigation (so users feel the connection)

Create a single unified area called **“My Journey”** in the dashboard with tabs:

1. **Saved Lands**
2. **Offers**
3. **Transactions**
4. **Services (Agents/Professionals)**
5. **Permits**
6. **Documents Vault**
7. **Support / Disputes**

This keeps the user from feeling like permits and professionals are “separate products.”

---

Noted. Below is a **clean, integrated extension** to the user workflows **plus** a **clear business model & subscription structure**, fully aligned with **Ghana land law**, escrow/instalments, and verification.

I have structured this so it can be dropped directly into your **PRD v1.1** and also used by **engineering + sales** without ambiguity.

---

# A. LAND POSTING STRUCTURE (FOUNDATIONAL DATA MODEL)

These attributes apply to **every land listing** and influence **search, pricing, payment plans, legal flow, and verification**.

---

## A1. Land Use Category (Primary Classification)

**Used for:** search, permits, valuation logic, and professional matching.

| Category      | Description                   | Permit Sensitivity |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Residential   | Housing (single/multi-family) | Medium             |
| Commercial    | Shops, offices, hotels        | High               |
| Industrial    | Factories, warehouses         | Very High          |
| Agricultural  | Farming, plantations          | Medium             |
| Mixed-Use     | Residential + Commercial      | High               |
| Institutional | Schools, hospitals, churches  | Very High          |
| Recreational  | Parks, resorts                | Medium             |

**Workflow impact**

* Determines **permit checklist**
* Determines **professional recommendations**
* Determines **allowed building types**

---

## A2. Land Tenure / Type (Based on Ghana Law)

This is critical and must be **mandatory**.

### Recognized Land Types in Ghana

(Aligned with Land Act, 2020 – Act 1036)

| Type               | Description                            | Sale Notes                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Stool Land         | Owned by stools (chiefs)               | Requires traditional authority consent |
| Skin Land          | Northern Ghana equivalent              | Same as stool land                     |
| Family Land        | Owned by family lineage                | Requires family resolution             |
| Customary Freehold | Perpetual interest under customary law | Common but risky                       |
| Leasehold          | Fixed-term interest (e.g. 50/99 years) | Most common                            |
| State Land         | Government-owned                       | Usually leasehold                      |
| Vested Land        | Joint state + customary ownership      | Special consent required               |
| Private Freehold   | Absolute ownership                     | Rare                                   |

**Workflow impact**

* Controls **verification complexity**
* Controls **lease period requirement**
* Influences **lawyer assignment**
* Affects **foreign buyer eligibility**

---

## A3. Lease Period (If Leasehold)

| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Lease duration  | 1–99 years          |
| Remaining years | Auto-calculated     |
| Start date      | Optional (if known) |
| Renewable       | Yes/No              |

**Workflow impact**

* Display prominently on listing
* Used in valuation guidance

* Required for permit application

---

## A4. Payment Structure (Sales Model)

### Allowed Payment Types

| Type             | Rules                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Outright Payment | Default                      |
| Installment Plan | Optional (seller-controlled) |

### Installment Plan Attributes

| Field                 | Description              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Initial deposit (%)   | e.g. 20–50%              |
| Installment duration  | 3–36 months              |
| Installment frequency | Monthly / Quarterly      |
| Penalty terms         | Optional                 |
| Ownership transfer    | Only after final payment |

**Workflow impact**

* Creates **payment schedule**
* Locks title documents until completion
* Requires **escrow milestone tracking**
* Strongly tied to **dispute module**

---

## A5. Land Commission Verification Seal

### Verified Status Levels

| Level                     | Meaning               | Seal                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |

| Platform Reviewed         | Internal review       | Orange                    |
| Lands Commission Verified | Official verification | **Green Verified Seal** ✅ |

### Verified Seal Rules

* Seal appears:

  * On listing cards
  * On listing detail page
  * On transaction workspace
* Seal links to **verification certificate**
* Seal is **immutable** unless revoked

**Workflow impact**

* Buyers can filter by “Verified Only”
* Verified lands enjoy:

  * Higher trust
  * Featured ranking
  * Faster transactions
* Business monetization lever (paid verification)
